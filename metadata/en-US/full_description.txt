An icon pack forked from ICEcons with the goal of providing icons mostly for F-Droid and other FOSS apps. It was designed to look clean and simple, featuring only white icons and transparency for a see-through effect. Frost includes support for Trebuchet, KISS, Nova, Apex, Holo, ZenUI, ADW, and many more launchers. There are over <b>400 icons</b>, as well as a few <b>4K wallpapers</b> included.

Submitting icon requests can be helpful, but maintaining the project takes a lot of time and effort, so please be patient about new icons. Most new icons are the result of a pull request from someone who wanted to add support for apps they used on their own phones. Contributions for new icons are always welcome and no experience with programming is necessary.
